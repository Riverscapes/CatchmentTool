## Catchment Tool
The **Catchment Tool** is an ArcGIS Python toolbox which currently includes one tool: 
*Delineate Catchments*. This tool was developed by [South Fork Research, Inc.](https://southforkresearch.org) 
to automate the process of delineating catchment area polygons for each stream reach 
or segment within a stream network. 

Futher documentation and help files are available at [http://riverscapes.github.io/CatchmentTool](http://riverscapes.github.io/CatchmentTool).
